  - May need to do additional research about training the model ourselves
  - Back End, SQL database and AWS: Farzad
  - Front End, website: Anusha

## Action Items
- Facial Recognition:
  - Use the OpenCV model to try getting the recognition working with their pre-training
  - Do some additional research on how to do our own training for a facial recognition model
- Back End:
  - Start a SQL database and start formatting the cells according to account information that will need to be stored.
  - Make a list of account information that will need to be stored in the database
- Front End:
  - Continue work on the website.
